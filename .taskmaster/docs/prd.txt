# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 🧩 Project Title:
**Chrome Extension – Keyword Rank Finder for Google Search**

---

## 📄 Description:
Create a Chrome Extension that allows SEO managers to input any **keyword** (e.g., "best boutique in Ahmedabad", "nautanky") and find its **ranking position** in **Google Search**. The tool should simulate a search query and scrape the SERP to detect in which position the keyword appears.

> **Note**: No need to check for specific domain or website — the focus is on **keyword visibility only**.

---

## 🎯 Goal / Outcome:
Allow users to identify where a keyword appears in Google Search Results (e.g., 5th, 12th, 21st, or "Not found in Top 100").

---

## 👤 User Story:
> As an **SEO Manager**, I want to input a keyword into a Chrome extension and get its ranking in Google search, so I can track keyword performance and visibility.

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Extension accepts **any keyword input**
- [ ] On click of **"Check Rank"**, Google search is simulated or opened
- [ ] Content script scrapes the search results (top 100 organic links)
- [ ] Extension returns keyword **rank position** (e.g., #3)
- [ ] If keyword not found: show `"Not found in top 100 results"`
- [ ] (Optional) Store keyword rank check **history locally**

---

## 🧠 Technical Details:

- Chrome Extension using **Manifest V3**
- Use `popup.html`, `popup.js` for extension UI
- Use `content.js` script to parse Google Search Results Page (DOM scraping)
- Logic to identify where the keyword first appears (based on title/snippet match)
- Use delay (`setTimeout`) to avoid Google bot detection
- Check against `h3`, `div`, and other visible text in result snippets
- Ensure results are sorted in rank order (1 to 100)

---

## 🧪 Testing Plan:

- ✅ Test various keyword types (e.g., brand, local business, long-tail keywords)
- ✅ Validate correct rank is returned (e.g., rank #1, #17, #39)
- ✅ Handle case where keyword is not found (return message)
- ✅ Test UI responsiveness and keyword input handling
- ✅ Validate against invalid or empty input

---

## 📁 Files to Deliver:

- `manifest.json`  
- `popup.html`  
- `popup.js`  
- `popup.css`  
- `content.js`

## 🚀 Optional Enhancements (Future Scope):

- Multi-keyword batch checking  
- Country/language selector for SERP localization  
- Export ranking result to CSV  
- Daily/weekly tracking with visualization
